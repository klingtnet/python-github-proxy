# Python API Proxy Example

**Disclaimer**: I implemented this just for educational purposes.  Don't expect any further progress in this repository.

This repository contains small API proxy that exposes some GitHub API resources.
It uses [Flask] for the server and [requests] for the GitHub API client.
Unit testing was done via [pytest].

[Flask]: https://pypi.org/project/Flask/
[requests]: https://pypi.org/project/requests/
[pytest]: https://pypi.org/project/pytest/
